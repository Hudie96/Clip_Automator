# 📖 Explain

Explain this to me:

$ARGUMENTS

## Workflow

1. **Big picture first**
   - What does this DO? (one sentence)
   - Why does it exist?

2. **Step through it**
   - Break into logical chunks
   - Explain each part
   - Use analogies where helpful

3. **Highlight the tricky parts**
   - What's non-obvious?
   - Common misconceptions?

4. **Summarize**
   - One sentence recap
   - When/why you'd use this
