# 🏗️ Build

I want to build:

$ARGUMENTS

## Workflow

1. **Clarify requirements**
   - What exactly are we building?
   - What's the scope? (MVP vs full feature)
   - Any constraints?

2. **Present approach**
   - High-level plan (3-5 steps)
   - Tech/patterns to use
   - Estimated complexity

3. **Get approval**
   - Don't start until confirmed
   - Adjust if needed

4. **Build incrementally**
   - One piece at a time
   - Verify each piece works
   - Explain key decisions

5. **Verify & summarize**
   - Test it works
   - Show how to use it
   - Note any limitations
