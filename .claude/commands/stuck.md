# 🧭 Stuck

I'm stuck and don't know what to do next.

## Workflow

1. **Assess current state**
   - Check recent files modified
   - Look for error messages
   - Identify last successful point

2. **Diagnose the block**
   - What were they trying to do?
   - Where did progress stop?
   - Is it a knowledge gap, bug, or decision paralysis?

3. **Present situation clearly**
   - "Here's where you are..."
   - "The issue seems to be..."

4. **Offer 2-3 paths forward**
   - Not 10 options — decision fatigue is real
   - Include effort estimate for each

5. **Recommend one**
   - Be opinionated
   - Explain why
